## Configuring Permissions in Slack
Before you can run the Slack GPT Bot, you need to configure the appropriate permissions for your Slack bot. Follow these steps to set up the necessary permissions:

1. Create [Slack App](https://api.slack.com/authentication/basics)
2. Go to your [Slack API Dashboard](https://api.slack.com/apps) and click on the app you created for this bot.
3. In the left sidebar, click on "OAuth & Permissions".
4. In the "Scopes" section, you will find two types of scopes: "Bot Token Scopes" and "User Token Scopes". Add the following scopes under "Bot Token Scopes":
   - `app_mentions:read`: Allows the bot to read mention events.
   - `chat:write`: Allows the bot to send messages.
5. Scroll up to the "OAuth Tokens for Your Workspace" and click "Install App To Workspace" button. This will generate the `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN`.
6. In the left sidebar, click on "Socket Mode" and enable it. You'll be prompted to "Generate an app-level token to enable Socket Mode". Generate a token named `SLACK_APP_TOKEN` and add the `connections:write` scope.
7. In the "Features affected" section of "Socket Mode" page, click "Event Subscriptions" and toggle "Enable Events" to "On". Add `app_mention` event with the `app_mentions:read` scope in the "Subscribe to bot events" section below the toggle.
